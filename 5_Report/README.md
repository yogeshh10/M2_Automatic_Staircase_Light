# **AUTOMATIC STAIRCASE LIGHT**
The automatic staircase lighting system is a lighting control system where the lights are automated according to the presence of people using the staircase.With this project, we will successfully create a system where lighting control will be purely based on human presence and hence eliminating the need for manual switching. This circuit can be used to save power, and it can be used as an emergency backup light.
## **REQUIREMENTS**
---
## **HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
- The motion should be detected by the sensor
- Power supply is required
- Presence of human 

## **LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
- Automatic on/off of light should happen
- Presence of darkness
- Sensor working
---
## **SWOT ANALYSIS**
## **STRENGTH**
- It is based on automation
- It can be easily implemented everywhere.
- It is affordable and confortable to use.
- Conservation of energy 
- User friendly

## **WEAKNESS**
- Less sensor life span

## **Opportunities**
- Wide rang of implementation

## **THREATS**
- The unstable power supply, fire could be considered as a threat
- Power cut
